Project Coyote Docs

To run locally:
1. Clone this repo
2. Run 'npm i' in the project root
3. Run the node server with '$ npm run start'
4. Navigate to http://localhost:3000 in your browser

The "start" script utilizes nodemon, which restarts your local server every time you make a change in any .js file!
